# Windows-Game-Hack


Note: I was responsible for the invicibility hack and wall hack (ESP). Project was completed with 
3 others (Kitch Kelly, Sean Michaelis, and John Lambert) over 2 months.

Tools used for invincibilty/wall hacks:

   - Visual Studio 2019 - IDE used to write code/debug.

   - Git - Used for version control.

   - C++ - All code was written using C++ (Windows.h library utilized).

   - OpenGL - Utilized by the wall hack for drawing boxes around enemy players.

   - CheatEngine - Used to track in-game memory addresses used.
